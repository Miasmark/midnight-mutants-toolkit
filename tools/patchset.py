## Why not just ship BPS files

A BPS is a delta between two whole files, with a CRC32 of the whole source and
the whole target. That is the right shape for "here is my hack", and the wrong
shape for "here are nine independent fixes, take the ones you want":

  - Nine fixes give 512 combinations. Nine BPS files cannot express them; you
    would have to build and ship every combination you want anyone to have.
  - A whole-file CRC means a patch refuses a dump that differs anywhere,
    including in a header it does not care about.
  - Two patches that happen to touch the same bytes apply cleanly one after the
    other and silently produce a ROM that is neither.

Nothing standard fixes this. VCDIFF has windows with optional per-window
checksums, but they are chosen by the compressor and mean nothing to a person.
NINJA (.RUP) and BPM bundle patches for *several files*; neither addresses
several regions of one file. PPF validates one hardcoded block. So this format
exists, and it is deliberately boring: JSON plus BPS files, in a zip or a
directory.

## What it adds

**Sections.** A named byte range with a CRC32 of its *pre-image*. A patch names
the section it edits, so applying it checks 168 bytes rather than 49152 -- and a
dump with a different header, or with another fix already applied elsewhere,
still passes.

**Knobs.** Each option says what it has an opinion about. Two options turning
the same knob are alternatives, and asking for both is refused as a choice not
yet made, rather than applied in file order.

**Floats.** Some fixes need somewhere to put new code, and hardcoding an
address is how a patch stops working on a dump that differs. A float declares
how much room it needs and where to look:

    "length": 32, "search": [{"addr": "0xFF00", "length": 256}], "fill": 0

The patcher finds a run of that many bytes all equal to `fill` in the search
ranges, drops the blob there, and writes the address it chose into every fixup
site the float lists. Two floats never get the same space.

(The obvious phrasing for this is "find 16 bytes with a CRC of zero", and the
test here is on the bytes instead, because CRC32 of sixteen zero bytes is not
zero -- it is 0x8B9F9C56. Same intent, honest arithmetic.)

**Headers.** The target is described by the size and SHA-256 of its *body*.
A `.a78` with a 128-byte header and a headerless `.bin` are the same body, so
the same bundle applies to both and the header is handed back untouched.

## The format

An **.abp** -- an anchored bundle of patches. A zip, so it opens in anything:

    patchset.json          the manifest
    p/<option>.<sec>.bps   one BPS per (option, section) pair
    f/<float>.bin          raw bytes for each float

A directory or a zip containing them; both are read the same way.
